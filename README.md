# useful-code-snippets
A searchable collection of useful little pieces of code

I'm saving any sort of useful fragment of code in this repo.

You can do a basic keyword search across all of the scripts using [search.py](./search.py), for example:

```bash
$ python search.py "google cloud bigquery to cloud storage"
```

Your query is compared against the script tags (tags are at the top of each code snippet script).

Words joined by underscore in the search query are considered a single phrase e.g. google_cloud_storage is interpreted by the search as "google cloud storage"
